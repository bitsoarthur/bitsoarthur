Arch Linux Netboot
About Netboot

Netboot images are small (<1MB) images that can be used to download the latest Arch Linux release on the fly upon system boot. It is unnecessary to update the netboot image, the newest release will be available automatically.

Netboot uses customized iPXE builds. The Linux kernel, initramfs and squashfs files for the live system are downloaded from an Arch Linux mirror. The integrity of all downloaded files is verified with cryptographic signatures.
Requirements

To use netboot, the following requirements must be met:

    Wired (ethernet) internet connection with DHCP autoconfiguration
    Sufficient memory to store and run the live system

Download
BIOS

    ipxe-arch.lkrn (PGP signature) - Linux kernel-like image that can be started with any Linux bootloader
    ipxe-arch.pxe (PGP signature) - PXE image for chainloading from a PXE environment

UEFI

    ipxe-arch.efi (PGP signature) - x86_64 UEFI executable

You can build your own iPXE images compatible with netboot. For details, check out the ipxe package.
